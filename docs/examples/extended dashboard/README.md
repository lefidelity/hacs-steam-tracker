Open Home Assistant, go to your dashboard, click the three dots → **Edit dashboard** → three dots again → **Raw configuration editor**, and paste the contents of the desired YAML file. The easiest way to copy everything is to open the file on GitHub and use the **Raw** view.

The example makes use of a few popular custom cards. Install them via HACS so the layout renders correctly:

- [button-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card)
- [config-template-card](https://github.com/iantrich/config-template-card)
- [entity-progress-card](https://github.com/t1m0thyj/entity-progress-card)
- [bar-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/bar-card)
- [flex-table-card](https://github.com/custom-cards/flex-table-card)
- [card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)

Feel free to adapt the cards, colors, or layout to match your own setup.
